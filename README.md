# Quantum simulators based on Sympy

This module contains [Qiskit](https://www.qiskit.org/) simulators with Sympy Provider. The simulators simulate a quantum circuit on a classical computer.

## Installation


```
git clone git@github.com:Qiskit/qiskit-sympy-provider.git
cd qiskit-sympy-provider
pip install -e .
```

PIP will handle all dependencies automatically.

## Usage

We recommend to follow the [usage example](examples/sympy_statevector.py). More general information and education on running quantum simulation can be found in the [Qiskit instructions page](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-core) and the Qiskit tutorials.

## Authors 

The Qiskit Sympy Provider was originally authored by Peng Liu and Marco Pistoia.

And continues to grow with the help and work of many people who contribute to the project at different levels.
